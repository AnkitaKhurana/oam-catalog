## Getting Started

OpenAerialMap Catalog is an application programming interface (API) that serves metadata about available images and map layers. The API provides access to all imagery metadata information. The API provides endpoints for lists of images available, map layer services available, as well as simple analytics. 

More information on [installation and running a stand-alone instance](https://github.com/hotosm/oam-catalog) of the API can be found on Github. 

See [status.openaerialmap.org](https://oam-status.herokuapp.com/) for more information on system status.
